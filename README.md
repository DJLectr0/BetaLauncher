BetaLauncher
============

This is a rudementary implementation of Testflight on desktop.

What is currently working:

- You can download apps
- They can be launched
- Updating works but after every restart it forgets you updated (This needs fixing on the QT code, so I do not have any idea when this will word)
- Uploading works and push for that will come later this week, but the progress is broken and finishing does not work either

What is planned:

- New UI
- Populating the news section using an rss feed with e.g. new updates and initial releases
- Login or beta key requirements
