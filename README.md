Testfighter
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DJLectr0/Testfighter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DJLectr0/BetaLauncher)

This is a rudementary implementation of Testflight on desktop.

What is currently working:

- You can download apps
- They can be launched
- Updating works but after every restart it forgets you updated (This needs fixing)
- Uploading works (But on yosemite dropping does not work)
- Populating the news section using an rss feed with e.g. new updates and initial releases

What is planned:

- CLI Interface for uploader and Github script for UE4 games
- New UI for both client and server
- Login or beta key requirement
- Stats
- Maybe iOS and Android compability
